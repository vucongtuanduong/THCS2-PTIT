# My thought
Came from next term to see back what I did in this term. To be honest, in general, I think I had done quite well this course. But the difference between this course and C++ course-which I have better results, is that I didn't have much chance to interact with my friends and learn from them, and also my mindset in programming is still naive since I first "official" take the programming course. \
Now, after taking the C++ course, my mindset is much better but still far from perfect and needs to practice more. Next term, I will take the DSA course , and I really hope I will have whole different way of thinking solution of a problem after I take that course.

Just quick lines of thought in my learning path to be a developer and my time in university
